# Vision-based-UAV-autonomous-landing
Official Implementation for Simulation and Real-Life Implementation of UAV Autonomous Landing System Based on Object Recognition and Tracking for Safe Landing in Uncertain Environments

## Setup
The simulation can be run on a desktop along with ardupilot SITL also 
the code for real-life implementation needs to be run in a companion computer
(preferably with GPU) with a connection to the UAV flight controller.
